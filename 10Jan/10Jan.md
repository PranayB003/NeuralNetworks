### Task
Design a class for students. The class should contain the student's first name, last name, age, roll no.
In addition, the class should contain a method which determines whether the student is a BTech, MSc or a PhD student.

## Neural Networks

### Task 1
A single input neuron has a weight of 1.1 and bias 2.0. What tu[e pf transfer function would we use if we'd like to get the following output?
Write down the corresponding input p.

### Single input neuron
$n = wp + b$
$a = f(wp + b)$
(insert image here)

### Transfer Functions
- Hard Limit
- Symmetric Hard Limit
- Linear
- Saturating Linear
- Symetric Saturating Linear
- Log Sigmoid ($a = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-n}}$)

- softmax: transfer function which is a multidimensional version of logsig
$[softmax(n_1, n_2, \cdot, n_d)]_i = \frac{e^{n_i}}{}$
